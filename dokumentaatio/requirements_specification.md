### Purpose of software
**CalendarApp** is a simple multi-user calendar with the basic features you would expect from a physical calendar: a (*customizable*) calendar view that displays the days of a week, a month or a year, the ability to add or remove notes on certain days, as well some not available on a physical calendar: reminders of notes coming up soon and the ability to search added notes.
### Users
Basic version will only have normal users that can create and delete their own accounts as well as do note-related things on their own accounts.
